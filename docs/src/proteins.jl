# Proteins

## Structures

You can load a Protein Structure from the PDB (Protein Data Bank):

```@example proteins
pstruc1 = viewstruc("2VB1")
```

## Multiple sequence alignments

You can similarly load a Multiple Sequence Alignment from the Pfam database:
```@example proteins
msa1 = viewmsa("PF00062")
```

#md # ![](msa1.svg)
#md # ![Image of msa](pf00062.png)
# An `MSAView` contains the most relevant information about the protein sequences in the
# alignment along with the `Scene` and `Layout` which comprise the interface.
