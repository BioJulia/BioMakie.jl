Makie Nodes are variables that other variables can listen to. Wrap the atom coordinates in a Node before plotting them so that the plotting machinery will be  able to respond to manipulations/updates of its value, and other behavior you give it. We can include more Nodes for things  like sliders and other controllers. Let's also make the atom radius into a Node and pass it to meshscatter as markersize.","category":"page"},{"location":"#There-are-at-least-2-ways-to-make-a-Node:","page":"BioMakie.jl","title":"There are at least 2 ways to make a Node:","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"BioMakie.jl","title":"BioMakie.jl","text":"cords = coordarray(atms) |> Node\natmrad = Node(0.5)","category":"page"},{"location":"#Here-we-do-the-same-thing-to-make-the-Figure-but-we-pass-the-plotting-function-our-Nodes,-so-that-we-can-manipulate-things-later.","page":"BioMakie.jl","title":"Here we do the same thing to make the Figure but we pass the plotting function our Nodes, so that we can manipulate things later.","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"BioMakie.jl","title":"BioMakie.jl","text":"fig = Figure(resolution = (800,600))\ngrid1 = fig[1:2,1:3] = GridLayout()\nscene1 = LScene(grid1[:,:], scenekw = (camera = cam3d!, raw = false))\nmeshfig = meshscatter!(scene1, cords; markersize = atmrad, color = :green, show_axis = false)\nfig","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"BioMakie.jl","title":"BioMakie.jl","text":"Now that we have the Figure, we can add more to it.
